      <p>I am a computer science student. I have been programming for a while but I haven't used HTML yet, it is fun and easier than some other languages I know. I know it also isn't a scripting language and is relativley simplistic               	   which might be why. I like to play video games and program. My dream is to be a game developer someday.</p>
